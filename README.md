## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Supabase (Required)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
   
   # OpenAI (Required for AI Coach)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   
   # Optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_USER_ID=your-dev-user-id  # For development
   CRON_SECRET_KEY=your-cron-secret  # For scheduled tasks
   WEEKLY_SUMMARY_SECRET=your-weekly-summary-secret  # For weekly summaries
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   
   Run the SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` in your Supabase SQL Editor, in order.

5. **Run the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Shift Coach is designed with shift workers in mind:

- **Non-Judgmental**: Never shames users for missed goals or irregular patterns
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts recommendations based on current state (RED/AMBER/GREEN)
- **Shift-Aware**: All features consider shift patterns, circadian rhythms, and recovery needs
- **Practical**: Focuses on actionable, realistic advice for shift work challenges
- **Empathetic**: Understands that shift work is hard and celebrates small wins

## 📚 Key Concepts

### Body Clock Score (Shift Rhythm Score)
A 0-100 score measuring how well you're adapting to your shift schedule. Factors include:
- Sleep quality and consistency
- Shift pattern regularity
- Recovery between shifts
- Circadian alignment

### Shift Lag
A measure of circadian misalignment caused by shift changes. Higher scores indicate more disruption.

### Biological Night
Your body's natural sleep window (typically 11 PM - 7 AM). Eating or being active during this time can disrupt circadian rhythms.

### Shift-Adjusted Nutrition
Calorie and macro targets that adapt based on:
- Shift type (day/night/off)
- Activity level during shift
- Sleep quality and recovery status
- Personal goals (lose/maintain/gain weight)

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
