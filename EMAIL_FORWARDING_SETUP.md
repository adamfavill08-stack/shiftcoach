# Email Forwarding Setup Guide

## Email Addresses Used in Legal Pages

Your legal pages now use these branded email addresses:

- **Privacy Policy:** `privacy@shiftcoach.app`
- **Terms of Service:** `legal@shiftcoach.app`
- **Health Data Notice:** `healthdata@shiftcoach.app`

All of these should forward to: `shift-coach@outlook.com`

## How to Set Up Email Forwarding

### Option 1: Using Your Domain Provider (Recommended)

If you own the `shiftcoach.app` domain, set up email forwarding through your domain registrar:

#### Namecheap (if that's your provider):
1. Log into Namecheap
2. Go to **Domain List** → Select `shiftcoach.app`
3. Click **Manage** → **Advanced DNS**
4. Add **Email Forwarding** records:
   - `privacy@shiftcoach.app` → `shift-coach@outlook.com`
   - `legal@shiftcoach.app` → `shift-coach@outlook.com`
   - `healthdata@shiftcoach.app` → `shift-coach@outlook.com`

#### Other Domain Providers:
Most domain registrars offer email forwarding. Look for:
- "Email Forwarding"
- "Mail Forwarding"
- "Email Aliases"

### Option 2: Using Outlook.com Email Aliases

If you have an Outlook.com account, you can:
1. Go to Outlook.com settings
2. Add email aliases
3. Set up forwarding rules

However, this only works if you have `@shiftcoach.app` email hosting, not just forwarding.

### Option 3: Using a Third-Party Email Service

Services like:
- **Google Workspace** (if you have it)
- **Microsoft 365** (if you have it)
- **Zoho Mail** (free tier available)
- **ForwardMX** (simple forwarding service)

## Testing Email Forwarding

After setting up forwarding, test it:

1. Send a test email to `privacy@shiftcoach.app`
2. Check if it arrives at `shift-coach@outlook.com`
3. Repeat for `legal@shiftcoach.app` and `healthdata@shiftcoach.app`

## Important Notes

✅ **This is a good practice** - Using branded email addresses looks more professional

✅ **Play Store compliant** - As long as the emails are monitored and respond to users

⚠️ **Make sure forwarding works** - Test all three addresses before launch

⚠️ **Monitor your inbox** - All emails will come to `shift-coach@outlook.com`, so make sure you check it regularly

## If You Don't Have Email Forwarding Set Up Yet

You have two options:

1. **Set up forwarding now** (recommended) - Use your domain provider
2. **Temporarily use direct email** - Change the legal pages back to `shift-coach@outlook.com` until forwarding is ready

Let me know which option you prefer!
